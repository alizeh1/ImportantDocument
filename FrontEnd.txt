1.What is CSS?  or What is CSS and what is its role in web development?
Answer: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML.

2.What is the difference between inline, block, and inline-block elements?
Answer:
Inline elements: They do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. Examples include <span>, <a>, and <strong>.
Block elements: They start on a new line and take up the full width available. Examples include <div>, <p>, and <h1>.
Inline-block elements: They are placed inline but behave like block elements. They start on a new line and allow other elements to sit beside them. Examples include <img> and <button>.

3.What is the box model in CSS?
Answer: The CSS box model is a way of representing the space taken up by an HTML element. It consists of content, padding, border, and margin. The total width or height of an element is calculated as: width/height = content + padding + border + margin.

4.What is the purpose of the z-index property?
Answer: The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of positioned elements. Elements with a higher z-index value are displayed on top of elements with lower z-index values.

5.How can you center an element horizontally and vertically?
Answer:
For horizontal centering: Set margin: 0 auto; on the element with a specified width.
For vertical centering: Use the flexbox or grid layout, or use the position property with top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%);.
OR
Horizontally: Use margin: auto; on the left and right sides of the element or text-align: center; on its container.
Vertically: Use display: flex; and align-items: center; on the container or use the position: absolute; and transform: translate(-50%, -50%); combination for the centered element.

6.What is a media query? How is it used in CSS?
Answer: A media query is a CSS technique used to apply different styles for different devices or screen sizes. 
@media media-type and (media-feature) {
  /* CSS rules to be applied if the media query conditions are met */
}

@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightcoral;
  }

7.Explain the difference between em and rem units.
Answer:
em units are relative to the font-size of the nearest parent or the element itself.
rem units are relative to the font-size of the root element (usually the <html> element).

8.What is the difference between position: relative, absolute, fixed, and static?
Answer:
Relative: Positioned relative to its normal position.
Absolute: Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (if any); otherwise, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block.
Fixed: Positioned relative to the browser window, and it won't move when the page is scrolled.
Static: The default positioning; the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

9.Explain the difference between padding and margin.
Answer: Padding is the space inside the border of an element,
while margin is the space outside the border of an element. 


10.How does the "float" property work in CSS?
Answer: The "float" property is used to align elements to the left or right within their containing element.

11.How do you select an element with a specific class in CSS?
Answer: You can select an element with a specific class using the dot notation. For example, to select all elements with the class "example," you would use .example in your CSS.

12.How do you select an element with a specific id in CSS?
Answer: You can select an element with a specific id using #. For example, to select all elements with the class "example," you would use #example in your CSS.

13.What is the "box-sizing" property used for?
Answer: The box-sizing property is used to control how the total width and height of an element are calculated. 
The default value is content-box, which includes only the content, but you can set it to border-box to include padding and border in the total width and height.

14.What is the importance of "clearfix" in CSS?
Answer: The "clearfix" technique is used to clear the float property.

15.How can you optimize the performance of a website with CSS?
Answer: Performance optimization in CSS can be achieved by minimizing the use of large images, combining and minifying CSS files, using efficient selectors,
and employing techniques like lazy loading for images.

16.What is responsive design, and how can you achieve it with CSS?
Answer: Responsive design is an approach to web design that makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. 
CSS techniques for achieving responsiveness include media queries, flexible grid layouts, and flexible images.

17.What is the difference between "class" and "ID" selectors?
Answer:
Class selectors are prefixed with a period (.) and can be used to style multiple elements on a page.
ID selectors are prefixed with a hash (#) and are used to style a unique element on a page.

18.How does the "position" property work?
Answer: The "position" property in CSS determines the positioning method of an element. Common values include "static" (default), "relative," "absolute," and "fixed."

19.What is the purpose of the "display" property?
Answer: The "display" property defines how an element should be displayed. Common values include "block," "inline," "inline-block," and "none.".

20.How can you include an external CSS file in an HTML document?
Answer: You can include an external CSS file in an HTML document using the <link> element within the <head> section, like this: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">.

<h2>The window.print() Method</h2>

<p>Click the button to print the current page.</p>

<button onclick="window.print()">Print this page</button>

</body>
</html>

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values
Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals.

Variable values are called Variables.

The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared

Variables defined with let must be Declared before use

Variables defined with let have Block Scope

Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here

Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here

Difference Between var, let and const
Scope	Redeclare	Reassign	Hoisted	Binds this
var	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
let	Yes	No	Yes	No	No
const	Yes	No	No	No	




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Hoisting</h2>
<p>With <b>let</b>, you cannot use a variable before it is declared.</p>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
try {
  carName = "Saab";
  let carName = "Volvo";
}
catch(err) {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = err;
}
</script>

</body>
</html>


Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using parentheses.

When using parentheses, the operations inside the parentheses are computed first:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>JavaScript Arithmetic</h1>
<h2>Operator Precedence</h2>
<p>Multiplication has precedence over addition.</p>
<p>But parenthesis has precedence over multiplication.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = (100 + 50) * 3;
</script>

</body>
</html>

Extracting String Parts
slice(start, end)
substring(start, end)
substr(start, length)

splice(whereNewElementAdd,HowMuchElementRemove,"Element",".."and so on) nd The slice() method creates a new array.The slice() method does not remove any elements from the source array.



When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction or multiplication and division), they are computed from left to right:

typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.

Why Functions?
With functions you can reuse code
You can write code that can be used many times.
You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.

variable contain single value,while object contain multiple value.eg..name:value pairs
Accessing Object Properties..syntax..objectName.propertyName or objectName["propertyName"]
Accessing Object Methods..syntax..eg..objectName.methodName()
In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.

In an object method, this refers to the object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.

If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string!

1.What is JavaScript?
Answer: JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for client-side web development. It allows you to add dynamic behavior to web pages.

2.What is the difference between let, const, and var?
Answer: let and const are block-scoped, while var is function-scoped.
let allows variable reassignment, const does not, and both let and const are hoisted but not initialized until the actual line of code is executed.

3.Explain hoisting in JavaScript.
Answer: Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.
However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

4.What is the event loop in JavaScript?
Answer:It's the mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, such as user input, timers, and network requests, in a non-blocking way. 
The event loop ensures that your code runs efficiently without waiting for time-consuming tasks to complete.

5.What is closure?
Answer:In programming, a closure is a combination of a function and the environment within which that function was declared. 
The environment consists of variables that were in scope at the time the closure was created.
eg.....
function outerFunction(x) {
  // This inner function is a closure
  function innerFunction(y) {
    return x + y; // innerFunction can access the 'x' variable from outerFunction
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

// Create a closure by calling outerFunction with a specific value
const closureExample = outerFunction(10);

// Now, you can use the closure to add 5 to the 'x' value (which is 10)
const result = closureExample(5);

console.log(result); // Output: 15

6.What is the difference between == and ===?
Answer:
== is an equality operator that performs type coercion (tries to convert operands to the same type before comparison).
=== is a strict equality operator that does not perform type coercion; it checks both value and data type.

7.What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?
Answer: The this keyword refers to the current execution context. In a global context, it refers to the global object (e.g., window in a browser). 
In a function, its value depends on how the function is called (e.g., with the new keyword, as a method, etc.).

8.Explain the same-origin policy and how it relates to AJAX requests.
Answer: The same-origin policy is a security measure that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.
AJAX requests are subject to the same-origin policy, meaning they can only make requests to the same domain unless the server supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

9.Explain the difference between null and undefined.
Answer: null is an assigned value that represents no value or no object. undefined is a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

10.What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?
Answer: Synchronous programming executes code sequentially, one statement at a time. 
Asynchronous programming allows code to continue executing while waiting for certain operations to complete, using mechanisms like callbacks, promises, or async/await.

11.What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript?
Answer: The this keyword refers to the object on which a method is being invoked or the context in which a function is called. 
Its value is determined by how a function is called (method invocation, function invocation, constructor invocation, or using apply or call).

12.What are the key features of JavaScript?
Answer: JavaScript is a versatile language with features such as event-driven programming, asynchronous programming, and a prototype-based object model.

13.What is JavaScript and how does it differ from Java?
Answer: JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. 
It is primarily used for client-side development in web browsers. 
Java, on the other hand, is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for a variety of applications, including server-side development.

14.What is a callback function?
Expected answer: A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, 
which is then invoked inside the outer function. It is often used to handle asynchronous operations or to execute code after a certain event occurs.

15.What are the data types in JavaScript?
Answer: JavaScript has primitive data types such as string, number, boolean, null, and undefined. Additionally, there is the object data type, which includes arrays and functions.

16. How do you declare a function in JavaScript?
Answer:
function myFunction() {
  // function body
}

17.Write a function to find the sum of two numbers.
Answer:
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Example usage:
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 7;
let sum = addNumbers(num1, num2);

console.log(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is: ${sum}`);

18.Explain how to check if a variable is an array?
Answer:
let myVariable = [1, 2, 3];

if (Array.isArray(myVariable)) {
  console.log("It's an array!");
} else {
  console.log("It's not an array.");
}

19.Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number.?
Answer:
function findLargestNumber(numbers) {
  if (!Array.isArray(numbers) || numbers.length === 0) {
    console.log("Please provide a valid array of numbers.");
    return undefined;
  }

  return Math.max(...numbers);                       //returns the largest of the numbers given as input parameters
}

// Example usage:
let numbersArray = [5, 8, 2, 10, 3];
let result = findLargestNumber(numbersArray);

console.log(`The largest number is: ${result}`);

o/p:
The largest number is: 10

20.How do you iterate over elements in an array?
Answer:
Using for loop-
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(myArray[i]);
}

Using forEach method-
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

myArray.forEach(function(element) {
  console.log(element);
});

21.how can i access element using javascript?
Answer:
Using getElementById-
<div id="myElement">Hello, World!</div>                    //html
var element = document.getElementById("myElement");       //javascript

Using getElementsByClassName or getElementsByName-
<div class="myClass">Element 1</div>
<div class="myClass">Element 2</div>
var elements = document.getElementsByClassName("myClass");

Using getElementsByTagName-
<p>Paragraph 1</p>
<p>Paragraph 2</p>
var paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");

Using querySelector and querySelectorAll-
<div class="container">
    <p class="myClass">Paragraph 1</p>
    <p class="myClass">Paragraph 2</p>
</div>
var element = document.querySelector(".container .myClass"); // selects the first matching element
var elements = document.querySelectorAll(".container .myClass"); // selects all matching elements

25.Explain operators in javascript?
Answer:
Arithmetic Operators-
+ (Addition)
- (Subtraction)
* (Multiplication)
/ (Division)
% (Modulus - returns the remainder of a division)
eg...
var x = 10;
var y = 3;

var sum = x + y;  // 13
var difference = x - y;  // 7
var product = x * y;  // 30
var quotient = x / y;  // 3.333...
var remainder = x % y;  // 1

Assignment Operators-
= (Assignment)
+= (Addition assignment)
-= (Subtraction assignment)
*= (Multiplication assignment)
/= (Division assignment)
%= (Modulus assignment)
eg..
// Assignment Operator (=)
var x = 5;
var y = 10;

// Addition Assignment (+=)
x += 3;  // Equivalent to: x = x + 3;
// Now, x is 8

// Subtraction Assignment (-=)
y -= 4;  // Equivalent to: y = y - 4;
// Now, y is 6

// Multiplication Assignment (*=)
var z = 3;
z *= 2;  // Equivalent to: z = z * 2;
// Now, z is 6

// Division Assignment (/=)
var a = 12;
a /= 4;  // Equivalent to: a = a / 4;
// Now, a is 3

// Modulus Assignment (%=)
var b = 17;
b %= 5;  // Equivalent to: b = b % 5;
// Now, b is 2 (remainder of 17 divided by 5)

Comparison Operators-
== (Equality)
=== (Strict equality)
!= (Inequality)
!== (Strict inequality)
> (Greater than)
< (Less than)
>= (Greater than or equal to)
<= (Less than or equal to)
eg..
// Equality (==)
var isEqual = 5 == "5";  // true, loose equality allows type coercion
console.log(isEqual);

// Strict Equality (===)
var isStrictEqual = 5 === "5";  // false, strict equality checks both value and type
console.log(isStrictEqual);

// Inequality (!=)
var isNotEqual = 10 != "10";  // false, loose inequality allows type coercion
console.log(isNotEqual);

// Strict Inequality (!==)
var isStrictNotEqual = 10 !== "10";  // true, strict inequality checks both value and type
console.log(isStrictNotEqual);

// Greater Than (>)
var isGreaterThan = 15 > 10;  // true
console.log(isGreaterThan);

// Less Than (<)
var isLessThan = 20 < 25;  // true
console.log(isLessThan);

// Greater Than or Equal To (>=)
var isGreaterOrEqual = 30 >= 30;  // true
console.log(isGreaterOrEqual);

// Less Than or Equal To (<=)
var isLessOrEqual = 40 <= 35;  // false
console.log(isLessOrEqual);

Logical Operators-
&& (Logical AND)
|| (Logical OR)
! (Logical NOT)
eg..
var condition1 = true;
var condition2 = false;

console.log(condition1 && condition2);  // false
console.log(condition1 || condition2);  // true
console.log(!condition1);  // false

Unary Operators-
+ (Unary plus)
- (Unary minus)
++ (Increment)
-- (Decrement)
eg..
// Unary Plus (+)
var positiveNumber = +10;  // No change, unary plus does not affect positive numbers
console.log(positiveNumber);

var stringToNumber = +"5";  // Converts a string to a number
console.log(stringToNumber);

// Unary Minus (-)
var negativeNumber = -15;  // Changes the sign of the number
console.log(negativeNumber);

var stringToNegativeNumber = -"8";  // Converts a string to a negative number
console.log(stringToNegativeNumber);

// Increment (++)
var counter = 5;
counter++;  // Increment by 1
console.log(counter);

// Decrement (--)
var countdown = 8;
countdown--;  // Decrement by 1
console.log(countdown);

Conditional (Ternary) Operator-
condition ? expr1 : expr2
eg..
var age = 20;
var message = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";

Bitwise Operators-
& (Bitwise AND)
| (Bitwise OR)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
~ (Bitwise NOT)
<< (Left shift)
>> (Right shift)
>>> (Unsigned right shift)
eg..
// Bitwise AND (&)
var resultAND = 5 & 3;  // 0101 & 0011 = 0001 (1 in decimal)
console.log(resultAND);

// Bitwise OR (|)
var resultOR = 5 | 3;  // 0101 | 0011 = 0111 (7 in decimal)
console.log(resultOR);

// Bitwise XOR (^)
var resultXOR = 5 ^ 3;  // 0101 ^ 0011 = 0110 (6 in decimal)
console.log(resultXOR);

// Bitwise NOT (~)
var resultNOT = ~5;  // ~0101 = 1010 (-6 in decimal due to two's complement)
console.log(resultNOT);

// Left Shift (<<)
var resultLeftShift = 5 << 1;  // 0101 << 1 = 1010 (10 in decimal)
console.log(resultLeftShift);

// Right Shift (>>)
var resultRightShift = 5 >> 1;  // 0101 >> 1 = 0010 (2 in decimal)
console.log(resultRightShift);

// Unsigned Right Shift (>>>)
var resultUnsignedRightShift = -5 >>> 1;  // 11111111111111111111111111111011 >>> 1 = 01111111111111111111111111111101 (2147483645 in decimal)

    newParagraph.textContent = "This paragraph was added dynamically.";

    // Set any additional attributes if needed
    newParagraph.setAttribute("class", "dynamic-paragraph");

    // Append the new paragraph to the container div
    var container = document.getElementById("container");
    container.appendChild(newParagraph);
</script>

</body>
</html>

28.What are global variables? How are these variables declared, and what are the problems associated with them?
Answer:
Global variables in JavaScript are variables declared outside of any function or block.
// Global variable
globalVar = "I am global!";

function exampleFunction() {
    // Accessing the global variable inside a function
    console.log(globalVar);
}

exampleFunction();  // Output: I am global!

Problems associated with global variables-
// Script 1
var sharedVar = "Script 1";

// Script 2
var sharedVar = "Script 2";  // Overwrites the global variable from Script 1

29.What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?
Answer:ViewState: It is specific to a single page in a session.

</script>

48.Explain the difference between the .click() and .on("click", handler) methods in jQuery?
Answer: Both methods are used to attach a click event handler, but .on("click", handler) is more versatile as it can be used to attach multiple event handlers and handle dynamic elements.
Example:
<!-- Using .click() -->
<button id="btn1">Click me</button>

<script>
   $("#btn1").click(function() {
      alert("Button clicked!");
   });
</script>

<!-- Using .on("click", handler) -->
<button id="btn2">Click me too</button>

<script>
   $("#btn2").on("click", function() {
      alert("Another button clicked!");
   });
</script>

49.How can you handle multiple events with a single handler using jQuery?
Answer: You can pass multiple event types as space-separated parameters to the .on() method.
Example:
<button id="myButton">Hover/Click me</button>

<script>
   $("#myButton").on("mouseenter click", function() {
      alert("Mouse entered or clicked!");
   });
</script>

50.How can you prevent the default behavior of an event in jQuery?
Answer: You can use the event.preventDefault() method within the event handler.
Example:
<a href="https://www.example.com" id="myLink">Click me</a>

<script>
   $("#myLink").on("click", function(event) {
      event.preventDefault();
      alert("Link clicked, but default behavior prevented!");
   });
</script>

51.Explain the purpose of the event.stopPropagation() method in jQuery.
Answer: event.stopPropagation() prevents the event from propagating up or down the DOM hierarchy, stopping the event from triggering additional handlers.
eg..
<div id="outer">
   <button id="inner">Click me</button>
</div>

<script>
   $("#inner").on("click", function() {
      alert("Inner button clicked!");
   });

   $("#outer").on("click", function() {
      alert("Outer div clicked!");
   });
</script>
In this case, clicking the inner button will trigger both alerts. Now, if we modify the inner click handler to include event.stopPropagation(), only the inner alert will be shown.
$("#inner").on("click", function(event) {
   event.stopPropagation();
   alert("Inner button clicked!");
});
